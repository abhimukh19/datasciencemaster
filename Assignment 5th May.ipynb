    "Time-dependent seasonal components are systematic, calendar-related influences that are reasonably stable with respect to timing, direction and magnitude. They arise from natural conditions such as weather fluctuations that are representative of the season. An observed time series can be decomposed into three components: the trend (long term direction), the seasonal (systematic, calendar related movements) and the irregular (unsystematic, short term fluctuations)"

One way is to use the autocorrelation function (ACF) to determine if seasonality is present in a time series. Another way is to decompose the time series explicitly into a level component and two seasonal components. You can also do a time series plot of the data and examine it for features such as trend and seasonality"
